# How to update a project

If you'd like to update the code used to calculate the TVL of a DeFi project already listed on DefiLlama:

1. Fork the [Adapters repo](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters) (button towards the top right of the repo page).
2. Make your changes to the fork (generally easiest by cloning your new fork into a desktop IDE).
3. Make a Pull Request from your fork, to the main DefiLlama Adapters repo, with a brief explanation of what you changed.
4. Wait for someone to either comment on or merge your Pull Request. There is no need to ask for someone to check your PR as there a monitored regularly.



If you'd like to update the metadata (name, logo, description etc) of a project already listed on DefiLlama:

1. Join the DefiLlama [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bQNGsqgD).&#x20;
2. Message the 'listings' channel about the changes you'd like to make.
3. Wait for a response from the team.

If you don't have Discord account, you can always reach the DefiLlama team through Github or Twitter. Responses are generally quicker on Discord.



If you'd like to list or update the listing for an NFT project, also get in contact with the DefiLlama team over Discord.
