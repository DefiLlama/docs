# Testing

Once you're ready to debug your protocol file, add it to `protocols/index.ts`  (preferably in alphabetical order). Run `ts-node utils/test.ts [name of your protocol]` and it should save a `result.png` where you can see the result of your protocol file. Check that the values make sense and it looks like what you expected.&#x20;
